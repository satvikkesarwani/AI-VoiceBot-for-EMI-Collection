## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

#### Enhanced Loan Model
```python
class Loan(db.Model):
    # Custom Fee Configuration
    late_fee_type = db.Column(db.String(20), default='percentage')
    late_fee_amount = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    late_fee_grace_days = db.Column(db.Integer, default=3)
    additional_interest_rate = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    total_late_fees = db.Column(db.Float, default=0.0)
    last_calculation_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

## Usage Guide

### For Agents

#### 1. Configure Loan Fees
1. Navigate to Client Details
2. Click on any loan item
3. Click "Configure" button
4. Set custom fees:
   - **Late Fee Type**: Percentage or Fixed Amount
   - **Late Fee Amount**: Amount or percentage
   - **Grace Days**: Days before late fee applies
   - **Additional Interest**: Extra interest rate for overdue

#### 2. Generate Payment Invoices
1. From loan item, click "Send Link"
2. System automatically:
   - Calculates current dues (EMI + late fees + interest)
   - Creates professional Razorpay invoice
   - Sends SMS and email to client
   - Provides shareable payment link

#### 3. Monitor Payments
- Payments are automatically detected via webhooks
- Loan status updates in real-time
- Payment history is maintained
- Fee calculations adjust automatically

### For Developers

#### 1. Custom Fee Calculation
```python
from fee_calculation_service import FeeCalculationService

# Calculate fees for a loan
calculation = FeeCalculationService.calculate_fees_for_loan(loan_id)
print(f"Total due: â‚¹{calculation['total_due']}")
```

#### 2. Create Invoice
```python
from razorpay_service import RazorpayService

service = RazorpayService()
invoice = service.create_and_send_invoice(
    loan_id=loan_id,
    custom_amount=5000,  # Optional
    send_sms=True,
    send_whatsapp=False
)
```

#### 3. Process Manual Payment
```python
# POST to /webhooks/manual-payment
{
    "loan_id": "loan_uuid",
    "amount": 5000.00,
    "payment_method": "cash",
    "notes": "Manual payment entry"
}
```

## Fee Calculation Logic

### 1. Late Fee Calculation
```python
if days_past_grace > 0:
    if loan.late_fee_type == 'percentage':
        late_fee = base_emi * loan.late_fee_amount / 100
    else:
        late_fee = loan.late_fee_amount
```

### 2. Additional Interest
```python
if loan.additional_interest_rate > 0:
    daily_rate = loan.additional_interest_rate / 100 / 365
    additional_interest = outstanding_amount * daily_rate * days_past_grace
```

### 3. Payment Allocation Priority
1. **Accumulated Late Fees** (from previous months)
2. **Current Late Fee** (this month)
3. **Additional Interest** (overdue interest)
4. **EMI Amount** (regular installment)
5. **Principal Reduction** (excess amount)
